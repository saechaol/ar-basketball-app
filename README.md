## ar-basketball-app
This is an application built in 36 hours for SacHacks 2021. It's an AR basketball app built using ARKit and RealityKit. It will project a basketball court, hoop and ball, and you can swipe it into the hoop.

Overall, a fun experience because neither my team, nor I, had prior or strong experience with either Swift or Augmented Reality, making this an enjoyable learning experience.
